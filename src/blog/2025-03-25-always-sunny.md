Here we go with another life update. There honestly isn't _too_ much to write about, but I'm due for another post.

Going into the new year felt kind of scary. January went by quickly and I thought that February was going to be the final month that I was going to be considered stable and able to pay my bills. Fortunately, some things happened and it got better. Then this month came around and _then_ I was worried again. The bills in general are nearly an entire month's worth of pay and it's been a struggle to keep up with them, mostly because of the condo mortgage and the car payments I had. I had to also consider the phone, internet, and car insurance. I also had Nala's veteraniary bills to pay for her CareClub membership, food, and medication to prevent fleas, ticks, and heartworms.

March was a hard reset for me, in multiple ways. I had to re-evaluate my budget and see what I could cut out to save and not worry about all of this insanity. I canceled game subscriptions for VRChat+ and Final Fantasy XIV. This saved me about $30/month which is something, but then I remembered I don't need to pay as much for internet and lowered my speeds back to what they were a while ago (I upgraded the speeds since I thought my streams were dropping from lack of good upload and download speeds to Twitch) and now that's only $60/month.

Earlier in the month, around the very beginnig, I was on lunch at work and talking to a coworker about stress with finances and finding a secondary job. The customer they were helping mentioned running DoorDash and how they made a lot of money doing it. Funny thing was I had tried to sign up maybe a month or two after losing my last job and they said to check back in 24 to 48 hours. That duration turned into a week, then a month, and I just kind of gave up checking on it. I reluctantly checked again and was able to sign up. It took a few days for the background check to clear, but as soon as I could start I did.

So far I've gotten a good net positive income of ~$600 extra this month. I'll be able to pay the mortgage and car, maybe have some extra left over. It just depends, but I have Friday and Sunday to do more DoorDash and earn even more money. Come Monday I'll have that money in my account, pay the mortgage and car, and see what's left. I'm hoping I can start saving money again and not worry about the bills.

Once I have enough money I'll feel a *lot* better, but between payment from Walmart today and DoorDash yesterday, I have hope again. Unfortunately, my parents are still not willing to help me out with anything, but that's fine. I'll be able to do this on my own and I'll be able to get through this.
